## Recipe Blog 

The objective of this project was to build a MongoDB-backed Flask project for a recipe website. 

This project consists of a

It leads on to the Recipes page which contain 

There is also a page to add a recipe and an About page. The user can log in or register also.

## UX

The main goal in the design of this project 

I wanted to implement a colour palette which XXXX . 

With this dashboard, the target audience consists of all age groups who have an interest in cooking and food.

### User Stories

* As an individual interested in cooking, 

* As a user who wishes to know what dishes are popular, 

* As a user who may be of an older demographic, I want a website which is easily navigated so that I can move through the webpage with ease.

* As a user who may be of a young demographic, I want the information to be laid out in a way that is understandable in order to make the most of the information present. 

* As a user I would prefer the option to reset the chosen filters to avoid having to individually remove each of the filters myself. 

## Wireframes

My website consists of the following features: 

* **Navbar**: The navbar contains XXX

* **Search**: This feature allows the user to search for a particular recipe in the database. 

* **Recipe filter**: This feature allows the user to filter the data according to a specific artist.

* **Reset Button**: This feature that enables users to reset their selection.

* **Footer**: A footer at the end contains a link to the dataset and a link to Spotifyâ€™s main page. 

* **Responsive**: This dashboard has been made responsive so it allows the user to access this page through their mobile, tablet or desktop and have a pleasant user experience each time.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages 

[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) -
HTML was used to control the layout and the structure of the dashboard.

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) -
Cascading Style Sheets are used to describe the appearance of a website and I used it to make my website look appealing to the user.

[Javascript]( https://www.javascript.com/) - 
Javascript was used to introduce the interactive elements to the project. 

[Python]( https://www.python.org/) - 
XXXX

### Database

[MongoDB]( https://www.mongodb.com/) - 
XXXX

### Frameworks 

[Flask]( https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) - 
XXXX

[Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/) - 
Bootstrap is a very useful CSS Framework. You can save time writing code by using the Bootstrap predefined design templates. It has a great grid system and is responsive to different screen resolutions.

### Libraries 

[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - 
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) - 
Gitpod is the code editor I used to write the HTML and CSS.

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - 
Font Awesome is a great library of icons. I used this library for my link icons.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - 
There is a great selection of fonts in the Google Fonts library, some of which I used in my project. 

### Also

[Gifox](https://gifox.io/) - 
I used Gifox to record the website demo for my README file. I recorded it off the website [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelbiggs.github.io%2Fifd-milestoneproject%2F#)

## Testing
* As an individual interested in finding recipes, I believe XXX.

* As a user of an older age, I want it to be as easily navigated as possible and attractive on a desktop or tablet. 

There was a bug with XXXX 

### Code Validation

#### CSS
I validated my CSS code using [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). This showed no errors.

#### HTML
I validated my CSS code using [W3C Markup Validation Service]( https://validator.w3.org/). This helped me to spot any small mistakes to the code and to clean it up. 

#### JavaScript
The JavaScript code in my project was validated using [JSHint]( https://jshint.com/). This was really useful in identifying any extra semicolons that I may have missed and for cleaning my code. 

### Jasmine
When researching whether to test my code with Jasmine, I could use Jasmine to test XXX

I created tests for these which can be seen in `<graphSpec.js>` and run by previewing `<tests.html>` or on [Github](https://melbiggs.github.io/ifd-milestoneproject/tests.html). You may need to refresh the page a few times to see an accurate result.

### Responsiveness
I tested the responsiveness of the webpage on browsers such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari and on multiple mobile devices. The page is fully responsive and I am satisfied that it works well on all devices.

### Peer Code Review
I published my project on the Code Institute's 'Peer Code Review' channel. This channel allows other students to have a look at your code and offer suggestions and comments to improve your project.
